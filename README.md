I recently graduated with a B.Sc. in Software and Computer Engineering from the Technion, under the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I‚Äôm passionate about building systems that combine software and hardware, and I enjoy exploring new technologies to solve real-world challenges.

### üå± What I'm Learning
- Strengthening my skills in multithreaded programming and concurrent systems
- Enhancing my understanding of operating systems, focusing on processes, memory management, and system calls
- Exploring advanced concepts in machine learning and their real-world applications
- Diving deeper into algorithms and data structures to optimize performance and scalability
- Gaining insights into computer architecture, including CPU design and memory hierarchy

### üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on, which showcase my skills and interests in various areas of software development:

- **ATM-Banking-System**: Implemented a multi-threaded banking system in C++, using pthreads for concurrent ATM operations including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The system features transaction logging and periodic bank commissions, demonstrating my proficiency in concurrent programming and system architecture.

- **Smash Shell**: A C-based shell implementation designed to handle both built-in and external commands with advanced job management features. This project demonstrates proficiency in process control, signal handling, and job tracking. The shell includes capabilities for job suspension and resumption, background job management, and supports various built-in commands like cd, pwd, and exit. The implementation leverages POSIX APIs for process and signal management, showcasing expertise in developing a robust, interactive command-line interface.

- **Multithreading Simulator**: Developed a simulator for multithreaded processors in C/C++, supporting Fine-grained and Blocked MT configurations. Features context switching with or without penalties, simulates execution cycles, and adheres to specific memory access patterns. This project demonstrates expertise in CPU simulation, context management, and performance measurement.

- **Branch Predictor Simulator**: A C simulator for a configurable two-level branch predictor. It handles branch prediction using adjustable BTB size, history register size, and tag field size. The simulator predicts branch outcomes and updates the predictor state based on given traces, showcasing advanced skills in branch prediction and memory management.

- **Cache Simulator**: A C-based cache simulator that models a two-level cache system. It supports flexible configuration for cache size, block size, associativity, and access times. The simulator reads memory access traces to compute the miss rates and average access times for both cache levels. Key features include inclusive cache management, LRU eviction policy, and accurate performance metrics calculation.

- **Firewall-Simulation**: This project involves the design and implementation of a firewall simulation tool that emphasizes network security through packet filtering techniques. By utilizing C++ for core functionality and Bash for configuration and management, the simulation effectively mimics the behavior of a real firewall, allowing for customizable rules and traffic management. This project demonstrates my proficiency in network security concepts, C++ programming, and system-level scripting, showcasing my ability to develop practical solutions to complex problems in cybersecurity.

- **Student-Grade-Management-System**: This project involves creating a student grade management system using a linked list Abstract Data Type (ADT) and a shared object library. It features a command-line interface for managing student details and grades, enabling tasks like adding students and calculating averages. Bash is utilized for executing the provided program, enhancing user interaction. This project showcases my skills in C programming, data structures, and modular design.

- **Deep Learning Speech Analysis**: Developed a real-time lecture feedback system using deep learning. Built a neural network to process audio input and evaluate speech quality, identifying filler words, speaking pace, and clarity. Integrated audio preprocessing, spectrogram generation, and real-time inference. This project blends signal processing, neural networks, and UX considerations for educational enhancement.

- **Iron Dove ‚Äì Bird Detection and Targeting System**: Designed a real-time bird detection and tracking system using an ESP32 microcontroller, YOLOv3 for object detection, and servo-controlled targeting. Integrated embedded systems, computer vision, and mechanical actuation into a functional prototype. Demonstrated skills in hardware-software interfacing, real-time CV, and low-power embedded design.

- **Vehicle Damage Classifier**: Implemented an automated vehicle damage classification system using the ConvNeXt deep learning architecture. Applied transfer learning and extensive data augmentation, optimizing performance with Optuna. Achieved 97.3% accuracy on test data. The project combined computer vision, model optimization, and robust evaluation practices.

- **FPGA Game Design**: Created an interactive game using SystemVerilog for FPGA deployment. The game includes user input via keyboard, object motion, and collision detection, displayed in real-time. This project strengthened skills in digital logic design, finite state machines, and hardware-based game implementation.
